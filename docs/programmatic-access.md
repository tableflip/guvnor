## Programmatic access

It is possible to connect to boss from your own program.

Access is divded into two categories - [remote](programmatic-access-remote.md) and [local](programmatic-access-local.md).

If boss is running on the same machine as your program, that's local access. If it's on a remote server, it's, well, remote access.
